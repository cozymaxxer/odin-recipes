# odin-recipes
This project is to set up a rudimentary website (a recipe site in this case) in HTML.
Once it is finished, I will have demonstrated the abilites to:
1. Create a github repository (I also learned how to delete one lol)
2. Clone said repository to my local machine (in the repos folder)
3. Create boilerplate, link to the various pages, if applicable, and format the content
4. Likely add pictures and/or links
